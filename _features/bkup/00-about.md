Incredible advances are being made in image processing techniques and tools, but the scientists who use them typically donâ€™t have the opportunity to communicate with scientists who work on similar problems in different domains.

ImageXD comprises researchers from a variety of fields who work with images as a
primary source of data. We work to identify common principles, algorithms, and
tools.  We aim learn from one another while strengthening ties across
disciplinary boundaries.
