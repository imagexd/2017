Following the success of [last year's ImageXD meeting at
BIDS](http://www.imagexd.org/2016/06/21/inaugural-workshop.html), we are
organizing a second workshop at the [University of Washington eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu)
March 29-31,2017.

The workshop will follow the three-day format of the workshop from last year
with each day focused on a different activity:

### Learn

On Day 1 (Wednesday, March 29), four tutorials are planned:

- [NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib](http://scipy.org), an introduction to numerical analysis with Python.

  This tutorial is aimed at those familiar with Python, but who have not used NumPy, SciPy,
  and Matplotlib extensively before.

- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/), neural networks in Python.

  In this tutorial we learn how to train a neural network using the TensorFlow library, and how to
  then apply it to real-world data.

- [scikit-image](http://scikit-image.org/), image processing in Python.

  We introduce the scikit-image library, demonstrate its various capabilities, and
  do several hands-on exercizes to practice its use.

- [ImageJ](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/), image processing in Java.

  We explore ImageJ and its SciJava interface with examples in Python and Clojure.

- [Vani Mandava](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/vanim/) from Microsoft Research will present image processing use-cases of the [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) cloud.

### Discuss

### Create

On Day 3 (Friday, March 31), we will get together to work in teams to develop ideas opportunities
in data, software, algorithms, and learning. This open format will allow
participants to learn from each other, work together and explore concepts that
cross domain boundaries.
